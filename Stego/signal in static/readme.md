OBLIVION's primary communication networks are heavily monitored by VanGuard, forcing it to resort to legacy protocols for certain transmissions. This audio file was found in a corrupted system log, containing what appears to be an encrypted command broadcast.

The audio sounds like static and noise, but our signal analysts believe OBLIVION is using an old data transmission method from the pre-digital era. If you can decode this signal, you might recover a fragment of the Zero Code.



it comes with an audio file "oblivion_transmission.wav"
