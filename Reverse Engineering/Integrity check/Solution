## Access Code Solution: 57005

This document outlines the four-step process used to derive the 32-bit access code for the OBLIVION security terminal's 'challenge' executable. The key was found by reverse-engineering the validation logic and manually extracting hidden constants.

### 1. Analyzing the Validation Logic

The program was analyzed in a decompiler (like Ghidra) to determine the logic.

* Core Check: The program compared user input against a secret 32-bit value (SecretCode).
* Calculation: The code revealed SecretCode was created using a bitwise XOR operation (exclusive OR) on two global constants:
    SecretCode = ConstantA XOR ConstantB

### 2. Extracting Constants from the Binary

The raw values were extracted from the executable file's data section using terminal tools.

* Tools: readelf, dd, and xxd were used.
* Raw Data Found: ced6 0000 6308 0000

### 3. Applying Little-Endian Correction

The extracted raw bytes were corrected for the Little-Endian byte order to get the true 32-bit values:

* ConstantA (system_constants): ced6 0000 became 0x0000D6CE
* ConstantB (_DAT_00104044): 6308 0000 became 0x00000863

### 4. Final Calculation and Key

The final access code was determined by performing the XOR calculation:

* XOR Operation: 0x0000D6CE XOR 0x00000863
* Hexadecimal Result: 0x0000DEAD
* Final Decimal Key: 57005

The decimal value 57005 was the correct key to submit.
